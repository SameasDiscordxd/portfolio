Greetings! I'm Josh Sartin, and I'm delighted to have you here on my website. For the past 11 years, I've been navigating the roads as a dedicated truck driver, exploring the vast landscapes and experiencing the ever-changing dynamics of the trucking industry.

Throughout my journey, I've come to appreciate the importance of trucking in keeping the world moving. Yet, I believe there is even more we can do to enhance this vital sector. Driven by my passion for improvement and innovation, I am aspiring to step into the realm of software development to bring positive change to the trucking industry.

With an ardent desire to contribute my skills and insights, I aim to bridge the gap between my firsthand trucking experience and the vast potential of technology. By combining the two, I'm determined to develop cutting-edge solutions that will optimize efficiency, boost safety standards, and create a more sustainable future for truckers and the community at large.

Apart from my professional aspirations, my family holds the most significant place in my heart. As a proud husband to my wonderful wife, Ravin, and a loving father to my two precious children, Jaxon and Henry, my family is the driving force behind my pursuit of excellence. They inspire me daily to become a better version of myself and fuel my dedication to making a positive impact on the world.

Through this website, I hope to share my journey, experiences, and insights as I embark on this thrilling new chapter in software development and contribute to the betterment of the trucking industry. I'm excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts, industry professionals, and anyone who shares the vision of a technologically advanced and safer trucking community.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting adventure, and together, let's drive change and pave the way for a brighter future.

Warm regards,

Josh Sartin</p>
